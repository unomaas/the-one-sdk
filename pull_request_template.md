Please answer the following questions about your work:

0 - What language did you program in?
- TypeScript.
-- I chose TypeScript because it is a superset of JavaScript, which is the language I am most familiar with. TypeScript also has a lot of great features that make it easier to write and maintain code, providing a better developer experience, especially when working with a large codebase.

1 - Have you manually tested the SDK?

2 - Did you add a test suite? If so, how will we use it? If not, why?

3 - Did you use any 3rd party library? Why did you use it? What are the tradeoffs?
- Yes, I used the libraries 'microbundle' and 'isomorphic-unfetch'.
-- I used 'microbundle' to bundle the SDK into a single file, which makes it easier to use in other projects

4 - Do you feel this SDK makes it easier to interact with the API?

5 - If you had more time, what else would you add?

6 - What would you change in your current SDK solution?

7 - On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the highest), how would you rate this solution?

8 - Anything else we should keep in mind when we evaluate the project?
